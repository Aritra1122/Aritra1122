## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Aritra Basak

I'm a physics postgraduate with a deep interest in research and in developing tools that support scientific productivity â€” whether in **theory**, **experiment**, **phenomenology**, or **automation**.

My academic training included quantum field theory, general relativity, statistical mechanics, and spontaneous symmetry breaking, with MSc project work on electroweak symmetry breaking, the Higgs-Anderson mechanism, superfluidity, and superconductivity.  
I also maintain an interest in research and have a paper available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21332).

### ðŸ”§ Technical Interests & Projects

I'm currently working on:

#### ðŸ“š `bibfixer` (Ongoing Solo Project)  
An automation pipeline to extract and structure bibliographic references from scientific PDFs or `.bib` files. 
- Parses raw references using GROBID and enhances them via metadata APIs (arXiv, CrossRef, INSPIRE, etc.)  
- Handles real-world citation inconsistencies 
- Improves researcher workflows and citation generation
- Supports research productivity by eliminating redundant manual citation work.


### ðŸ’» Tools & Stack

- **Languages**: Python 
- **Technologies**: REST APIs, XML, JSON, Pandoc, LaTeX, BibTeX  
- **Systems**: GROBID, arXiv/CrossRef APIs  
- **Workflow**: Solo development, research-oriented automation, reproducibility

ðŸ“« Always open to collaboration or feedback â€” especially on tools that bridge research and technology.
